# Telco-Churn-Analysis-and-Modeling-XGBoost

### Problem statement
- There are promotional charges called as Acquisition Cost and Retention Cost in a telco company. The cost of acquiring new consumers is referred to as acquisition cost. Meanwhile, the expense of retaining existing clients is known as Retention Cost.
- We are frequently inaccurate in our predictions of which customers would churn and which ones will stay due to human limitations. As a result, the allocation of money may be incorrect, resulting in a higher amount of funds being issued.
- Moreover, according to some sources, the acquisition cost is 5x greater than the retantion cost. If we are wrong in predicting a customer who will actually churn, but it turns out that we predict as a customer who will retain, then we need to spend more than it should be.

### What to do
I will try to create a Machine Learning model to predict customer churn and retantion.

### Goal
Machine Learning has a goal so that cost allocation can be done as precisely as possible.

### Value
There is no wasted cost allocation.
